# Predator-prey model

One of the classic examples of complex systems is the predator-prey model. A famous mathematical description of the interactions in the predator-prey model are the [Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotkaâ€“Volterra_equations):

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} &= \alpha x - \beta x y, \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= \delta x y - \gamma y
$$

Where $x$ is the number of prey, $y$ the number of predators, $t$ time, and the other variables describe the interactions between species. The population of a species is allowed to be a floating point number

The math used in these equations is very simple, but resulting models can have very unique complex properties and variants have been successfully used to describe various real-life populations. One of the problems with the model lies in using it to describe small scale dynamics; having a quarter of a rabbit interact with two thirds of a fox is unrealistic.

In this module, we'll create a very basic predator-prey model that simulates a field with rabbits and foxes. We will visualize the system, such that we have direct visual feedback about the functioning of our code, and such that we can see the consequences of the behavioral rules that we add. This simulation will be programmed using the OOP paradigm, which will enable us to provide a very generic structure of an animal, onto which we can add properties that define the behavior of our predators and our prey.

## Field and Walker classes

Download [field.py](/for_students/field.py). We'll be setting up the field in which the rabbits and the foxes will move around. The `Field` class has a couple of properties and functions which we will first explain:

- `width`: This is the width of the field.
- `height`: This is the height of the field.
- `creatures`: This list will keep track of all creatures that are currently alive in the simulation
- `fig`, `ax1`, `ax2`: These variables will be needed to keep track of the plots we will make later.
- `add_creatures()`: Through this function we will add more creatures to the simulation.
- `draw()`: This function will draw our field, and all creatures on it. We will also add some fancy statistics to this function later.
- `step()`: This function can be used to take a single timestep in the simulation.
- `simulate()`: This function will take an argument through which we can take several timesteps in the simulation.

You will see that all functions are defined, but that most only have `pass` in them. This is simply a trick to make Python do nothing (while preventing errors), and it merely serves as a placeholder for the code we will implement later. We would create an empty field of equal width and height (100) as follows:

    meadow = Field(100, 100)

Now download [walker.py](/for_students/walker.py). In this file, we will be implementing our first walking creatures. `Walker` is a class that we will use as the basis for all our walking creatures, and all creatures have at least the following properties: a position (defined by an x and a y coordinate), a speed, and an angle. We expect to create a creature at x = 15 and y = 10, speed = 1, and angle = 0 as follows:

    creature = Walker(15, 10, 1, 0)

Create a third file `main.py`. This file will serve as the main point from which we will start our program. For now, you can keep this one empty.

## Implementing both `draw()` functions

To get our first good look at what our creatures look like, we will start with implementing the `draw()` function of both the `Field` and `Walker` classes.

We'll start off with `Field.draw()`. This function should draw the whole field with all its contents. A structure has been provided in which a plot window is created where two graphs can be drawn next to eachother horizontally. The left graph can be accessed (and drawn on) trough `ax1`, while the right plot can be acessed through `ax2`. For now, we will only need `ax1`.

To test our future code we will, for now, hardcode two creatures into the list of creatures of a field. Copy and paste the following code into `main.py`:

    from field import Field
    from walker import Walker

    simulation_field = Field(100, 100)

    creature1 = Walker(15, 10, 1, 0)
    creature2 = Walker(95, 10, 1, 0)

    simulation_field.creatures.append(creature)

    simulation_field.draw()

> The imports in the code above are so-called relative imports. Python will search for files named 'field.py' and `walker.py` locally, and by using the `from` keyword we only import the classes `Field` and `Walker`.

Running this code using `python main.py` will very briefly open a plot-window. To keep it open for longer, you can lengthen the `plt.pause()` in `field.py` to something like 5 seconds.

As you can see, the code already draws one blue dot exactly in the middle of the field. It is your job to change this code to draw dots for every creature in the list of creatures for this specific `Field`.

Navigate to the `draw()` function in `walker.py` and replace `pass` with `ax.plot()` in such a way that it would plot a dot on the location of the walker (use `self.x` and `self.y`) using the color from `self.color`.

If done correctly, we can now replace the line that plots a blue dot in `field.py` with `self.creatures[0].draw(self.ax1)` to make the first walker in the list draw itself to the left graph.

Create a for-loop that calls the `draw()` function of all objects in the list `self.creatures`.

You should end up with two _black_ walkers positioned on (15, 10) and (95, 10).

## Moving around



The Lotka-Volterra equations describe the change in the number of prey and the number of predators using based on a very basic set of rules:

1. The prey always have ample food
2. The predator population is entirely dependant on the prey population
3. The rate of change in populations is proportional to its size
4. The environment does not change and species do not adapt
5. Predators have limitless appetite.
